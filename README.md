For the 1st exercise: 
    I discovered that each number that does not have residual after divide it with 3 or 5, can be a multiple of one of them.

For the 2nd exercise: 
    - I tried to use a REGEX since I know the user can be a little bit unpredictable and can input any kind of digit or data.
    - I tried to make it dynamically, to start asking the user for the word that wants to be checked if Palindrome or not

For the 3rd exercise: 
    - I assumed that it would be better to seperate the repeated number from the unique ones, into two different arrays, so that it helps me
    to be more precise with the sum result.

For the to-do List: 
    
    - I considered all the scenarios possible to avoid any kind of error from my end, for instanc: 
        - The user digits an Option that is not described in the list
        - The user tries to delete a task that does not exist
        - The user wants to view tasks from an empty array
